//Interface Segregation Principle
//Here, RefundablePayment extends Payment, but a class that doesnâ€™t need refund functionality (like GiftCardPayment) can implement only the Payment interface.
//Interfaces are well-segregated, allowing flexibility.

class PayPalPayment implements RefundablePayment {
