## Introduction
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

## Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility.

## Open/Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Conclusion
Understanding and applying the SOLID principles helps in creating software that is easy to maintain and extend over time.
